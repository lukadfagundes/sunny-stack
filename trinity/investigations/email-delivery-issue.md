# Email Delivery Investigation Report
**Date:** 2025-09-10
**Subject:** Emails not arriving at luka@sunny-stack.com

## Current Status
- **Symptom:** Emails sent via Resend API show as "sent" but never arrive at luka@sunny-stack.com
- **Working:** Emails to external domains (Gmail) were working before we removed it
- **Not Working:** Emails to sunny-stack.com domain

## DNS Configuration Analysis

### MX Records ‚úÖ CORRECT
```
aspmx.1.google.com (priority 1)
alt1.aspmx.1.google.com (priority 5)
alt2.aspmx.1.google.com (priority 5)
alt3.aspmx.1.google.com (priority 10)
alt4.aspmx.1.google.com (priority 10)
```
All 5 Google MX records are properly configured and pointing to Google Workspace.

### SPF Record ‚úÖ PRESENT
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:amazonses.com ~all
```
This authorizes both Google and Amazon SES (Resend) to send emails for the domain.

### DMARC Record ‚úÖ CONFIGURED
```
v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:luka@sunny-stack.com
```
DMARC is in monitoring mode, which shouldn't block emails.

## Key Findings

1. **DNS records are correctly configured** for Google Workspace email receipt
2. **SPF includes both Google and Amazon SES** as authorized senders
3. **Resend shows 403 error** occasionally, suggesting domain verification issues

## Suspect List üîç

### Prime Suspect: Resend Domain Verification
- **Evidence:** 403 errors saying domain not verified
- **Theory:** When TXT records were deleted, Resend lost domain verification
- **Action Needed:** Check Resend dashboard for domain verification status

### Suspect #2: Missing Resend TXT Records
- **Evidence:** User deleted Resend's TXT records when troubleshooting
- **Theory:** Resend needs specific TXT records for domain verification and DKIM
- **Action Needed:** Re-add Resend's domain verification TXT records

### Suspect #3: Google Workspace Email Routing
- **Evidence:** Can receive automated emails but not from Resend
- **Theory:** Google might be blocking emails that appear to be from the same domain but come from external servers
- **Action Needed:** Check Google Workspace admin for blocked senders or routing rules

### Suspect #4: Email Authentication Conflict
- **Evidence:** Emails from sunny-stack.com going to spam
- **Theory:** DKIM signature missing or misconfigured
- **Action Needed:** Ensure Resend's DKIM records are added to DNS

## Investigation Steps Completed
1. ‚úÖ Verified MX records point to Google
2. ‚úÖ Confirmed SPF record includes both providers
3. ‚úÖ Found DMARC record in monitoring mode
4. ‚è≥ Need to verify Resend domain status in dashboard
5. ‚è≥ Need to check for Resend-specific TXT records

## Recommended Actions
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Log into Resend dashboard and check domain verification status
2. **IMMEDIATE:** Re-add any missing Resend TXT records for domain verification
3. **THEN:** Check Google Workspace Admin Console for:
   - Email routing rules
   - Blocked sender lists
   - Security settings that might block external services
4. **TEST:** Send test email after each change

## Status Update
Currently waiting for user to re-configure Resend DNS records. The most likely cause is that deleting Resend's TXT records broke domain verification, causing the 403 errors and preventing email delivery.
