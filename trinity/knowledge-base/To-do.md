## ðŸš¨ HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### Critical Security & Performance

1. **Missing Test Coverage** (CRITICAL)
   - No testing infrastructure in place (0% coverage)
   - Jest/React Testing Library setup needed
   - API route testing framework required
   - Component testing for critical forms
   - **Impact**: Production bugs, security vulnerabilities undetected
   - **Effort**: 2-3 days setup + ongoing test writing

2. **Large Component Refactoring** (HIGH)
   - `/app/quote/page.tsx`: 1,325 lines (exceeds 1000-line threshold)
   - Complex form logic mixing UI and business logic
   - Multiple state management patterns in single file
   - **Impact**: Maintainability, debugging difficulty, code comprehension
   - **Effort**: 1-2 days refactoring into smaller components

3. **API Route Security Hardening** (HIGH)
   - Rate limiting implemented but needs monitoring
   - Error messages may leak internal information
   - Input validation comprehensive but needs penetration testing
   - **Impact**: Security vulnerabilities, potential attacks
   - **Effort**: 1 day security audit and hardening
