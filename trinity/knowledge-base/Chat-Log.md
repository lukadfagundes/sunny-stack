└── investigations/
    └── prior-investigations/    ✅ Created
```

### 2. Comprehensive Protocol Documentation
- Created investigation templates for Next.js components
- Established performance monitoring protocols
- Defined quality gates for TypeScript/React
- Implemented crisis management procedures

## DECISIONS MADE

### Decision 1: Documentation Approach
**Choice**: Full, comprehensive Trinity Method documentation
**Justification**: Ensures complete knowledge retention and professional development standards
**Alternative Considered**: Minimal documentation
**Reason for Rejection**: Would compromise Trinity Method principles

### Decision 2: Project Structure
**Choice**: Maintain existing Next.js App Router structure
**Justification**: Aligns with Next.js 15 best practices
**Impact**: All components default to Server Components unless marked with 'use client'

### Decision 3: Performance Targets
**Choice**: Set aggressive performance targets (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms)
**Justification**: Demonstrates technical excellence and user experience focus
**Measurement**: Core Web Vitals and Lighthouse scores

## ISSUES ENCOUNTERED

### Issue 1: Repository Size
**Problem**: Trinity Method repository adding to project size
**Resolution**: Will clean up after documentation creation
**Status**: Pending cleanup

### Issue 2: Documentation Scope
**Problem**: Determining appropriate detail level for documentation
**Resolution**: Chose comprehensive approach per Trinity Method v7.0
**Status**: Resolved

## PATTERNS DISCOVERED

### Pattern 1: Hydration-Safe Component Pattern
```typescript
function useHydration() {
    const [isHydrated, setIsHydrated] = useState(false);
    
    useEffect(() => {
        setIsHydrated(true);
    }, []);
    
    return isHydrated;
}
```
**Use Case**: Preventing hydration mismatches in Next.js
**Effectiveness**: Eliminates hydration warnings

### Pattern 2: Investigation-First Development
```typescript
interface Investigation {
    current: Analysis;
    problem: Definition;
    solution: Proposal;
    impact: Assessment;
    success: Metrics;
}
```
**Use Case**: Ensuring evidence-based development
**Effectiveness**: Reduces bugs and rework

## KNOWLEDGE GAINED

1. **Next.js 15 App Router Insights**:
   - Server Components are default, reducing bundle size
   - Client Components need explicit 'use client' directive
   - Streaming and Suspense improve perceived performance

2. **Trinity Method Adaptation**:
   - Framework-agnostic principles apply well to Next.js
   - Investigation templates need minor adjustments for React patterns
   - Performance monitoring is crucial for modern web apps

3. **TypeScript Strict Mode Benefits**:
   - Catches potential runtime errors at compile time
   - Improves code maintainability
   - Aligns with Trinity Method quality standards

## NEXT SESSION REQUIREMENTS

### High Priority
1. Complete Session-Knowledge-Retention.md
2. Clean up Trinity Method repository
3. Fix identified hydration issues
4. Complete homepage implementation

### Investigations Needed
1. Investigate Resend API integration patterns
2. Research optimal image optimization strategies
3. Analyze bundle size reduction opportunities

### Technical Debt
1. Address TypeScript strict mode violations
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Add comprehensive logging system
