    config.metadata = { startTime: Date.now() };
    return config;
  },
  
  response: (response) => {
    const duration = Date.now() - response.config.metadata.startTime;
    console.log('🔽 Response:', { 
      url: response.config.url,
      duration: `${duration}ms`,

        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        duration = (time.time() - start) * 1000
        
        if duration > 100:  # Log slow operations
            logger.warning(f"⚠️ Slow operation: {func.__name__} took {duration:.2f}ms")
        
        return result
    return wrapper

## 📈 ARCHITECTURAL DECISION RECORD

### Decision 1: State Management Strategy
```yaml
date: "2025-08-11"
context: "Need efficient state management for complex UI"

  - Context API: Performance concerns
  - MobX: Learning curve too steep
  - Zustand + React Query: Optimal balance

decision: "Zustand + React Query"
rationale: |
  - Zustand for simple client state
  - React Query for server state
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Minimal boilerplate
  - Excellent DevTools

outcome: "SUCCESS"
validation: |
  - 50% less boilerplate than Redux
  - Better performance than Context API
  - Team productivity increased
  - Easier debugging
```

### Decision 2: Authentication Architecture
```yaml
date: "2025-08-12"
context: "Implement secure authentication system"
options_considered:
  - NextAuth.js: Limited FastAPI integration
  - Auth0: Cost and vendor lock-in
  - Custom JWT: Full control
  - Hybrid: JWT with refresh tokens

decision: "Custom JWT with refresh tokens"
rationale: |
  - Full control over implementation
  - FastAPI native support
  - Stateless architecture
  - Secure with refresh rotation

outcome: "SUCCESS"
implementation_insights: |
  - Access token: 15 minutes
  - Refresh token: 7 days
  - Secure httpOnly cookies
  - Token rotation on refresh
```

### Decision 3: Database Strategy
```yaml
date: "2025-08-13"
context: "Choose database for production"
options_considered:
  - PostgreSQL: Industry standard
  - MySQL: Familiar but limited
  - MongoDB: NoSQL not suitable
  - SQLite: Development only

decision: "SQLite (dev) → PostgreSQL (prod)"
rationale: |
  - SQLite for rapid development
  - PostgreSQL for production scale
  - SQLAlchemy abstracts differences
  - Migration path clear

outcome: "PENDING"
migration_plan: |
  1. Develop with SQLite
  2. Test with PostgreSQL locally
  3. Migrate schema with Alembic
  4. Deploy PostgreSQL in production
