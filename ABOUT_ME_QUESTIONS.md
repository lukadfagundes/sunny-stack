# About Me - Personal Questions

Please answer these questions to help create a more personable About Me section. Be as detailed or brief as you'd like - the goal is to show your personality and help visitors connect with you as a person, not just a developer.

## Basic Background
1. **Where are you from originally, and where do you live now?**
   - I was born in Reno, NV and lived in NV until October of 2001 when my familly moved to Natchitoches, LA, where I grew up and lived until May of 2020. I then moved to Nacogdoches, TX for a few years, until moving to Salem, OR in March of 2024.

2. **What did you do before getting into programming? What was your career path like?**
   - All over the place. I waited tables, bartended, and managed a restaurant for about a decade. The last seven years of that, I was pulling double duty working for an insurance company, specializing in bank protection. I was let go from my job in 2020 due to Covid and was jobless for about a year and a half until I began working as a used manufacturing equipment dealer. 

3. **What sparked your interest in programming? Was there a specific moment or project that got you hooked?**
   - I've always been intersted in programming, but never had the time, tools, or resources to really get invested into it. I officially started learning in 2016, teaching myself along the way. Life got in the way and I put it dow for a while, but recently my passion has been reignited and I finally "get it". The kick off for this passion comes from my current job as a used machinery sales rep. I needed a way to better value and review equipment in a timely manner, and ended up learning how to develop software while I was at it. 

## Personal Interests & Hobbies
4. **What do you like to do when you're not coding?**
   - I like to watch anime, play video games, doom scroll on the socials, and go check out waterfalls and nature, Oregon is a beautiful state. 

5. **Do you have any interesting hobbies or collections?**
   - Not necessarily a hobby, but I love One Piece and am always collecting One Piece art and little knicknnacks. I've bee playing guitar since I was 16. And I collect silly little coffee mugs. 

6. **What kind of music do you listen to? Any favorite artists or genres?**
   - I'm a big fan of music. I primarily listen to mid 2000's emo and pop punk, but I love most all genres. I like to listen to video game music when I work, and anime openings are always on the playlist. My top five favorite artists are Mayday Parade, Taking Back Sunday, Chapel Roann, Paramore, and Radwimps. 

7. **Are you into any sports, fitness activities, or outdoor adventures?**
   - Not a sports guy at all, BUT I do love nature. I'm always up for a lovely little hike with a view. I recently got married and after the ceremony we went on a hike to Abiqua Falls in Oregon and it was absolutely beautiful.

8. **What's your favorite way to spend a weekend?**
   - Friday night, me and the wife are out and about, wandering aimlessly, finding yummy spots to eat, seeing a movie, or getting some take out and playing video games together until the wee hours of the morning. Saturday's are for the vibes, weather depending we're outside, farmers markets, nature hikes, checking out the local thrift shops. Sundays are all about that relaxation, bed rotting, lazy cooking, and catching up on our shows, have you seen Yellowjackets yet? It's amazing!
