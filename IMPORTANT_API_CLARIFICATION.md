# Important Clarification: Max Plan vs API Access

## Your Current Setup:
1. **Max Plan ($20/month)**: For using Claude through claude.ai web interface
2. **API Access ($3/$15 pricing)**: For programmatic access via API key

## Key Points:

### Max Plan DOES NOT provide API access
- The Max plan is ONLY for claude.ai web interface usage
- It gives you more messages on the website
- It does NOT give you an API key or API access
- There is NO "claude-sonnet-4-20250514" model available via API

### Your API Key is SEPARATE
- Your API key (sk-ant-api03-...) is from your API account
- This bills separately at $3/million input, $15/million output
- This is what Sunny uses for the Claude Chat feature

### Available Models via API (as of now):
- `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` - Latest Sonnet (best quality)
- `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` - Latest Haiku (fastest/cheapest)
- `claude-3-opus-20240229` - Opus (most capable but expensive)

### What This Means:
- Your Sunny platform uses your API account (NOT Max plan)
- Each message costs approximately $0.01-0.03 via API
- The Max plan and API are completely separate products
- You're already configured correctly with Sonnet 3.5 (best available)

## Current Configuration:
- **Model**: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 (best available via API)
- **Billing**: Via your API account at $3/$15 rates
- **Max Plan**: Only for your personal use on claude.ai

## No Action Needed:
Your setup is already optimal. The confusion about "Sonnet 4" and Max plan API access is understandable, but:
- There is no Sonnet 4 available via API yet
- Max plan never provides API access
- You're using the best available model (Sonnet 3.5)

## Cost Management:
With Sonnet 3.5 at your $3/$15 rates:
- Average consultation: ~2000 tokens = ~$0.03
- Daily usage (50 messages): ~$1.50
- Monthly estimate: ~$45
- This is minimal compared to $45k client projects!

Your configuration is correct and optimal for the Sunny platform.
